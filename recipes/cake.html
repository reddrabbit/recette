    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This quick orange cake is delicious without the frosting. I sometimes just sprinkle icing sugar on the top. This recipe can be used to make two 8-inch cake layers or a 9x5-inch loaf. If making a loaf cake, bake for 60 minutes.</p>

            To make Orange Butter Frosting: Cream butter until smooth. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar. Beat until light and fluffy. Beat in 2 tablespoons orange juice to bring to spreading consistency. Stir in vanilla and 1 teaspoon orange zest.
